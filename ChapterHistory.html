        <h1>ROOTED IN OUR <span>Vision</span></h1>  
          <p class="main"> The year 1975 saw the birth of what was a vision  an idea of an organization, a Sisterhood that would cater to the needs of Latinas and the Universal Woman. Thanks to the tremendous strides made by our Seventeen Founding Mothers, this dream was realized and took form as the entity Lambda Theta Alpha Latin Sorority, Incorporated as the FIRST Latina sorority in the nation.</p>
            
            <p class="main">
          
            More than 30 years later, we have seen the outcome of such an organization. Lambda Theta Alpha has contributed to the advancement of all people by helping to produce educated women of many races, ethnicities, and creeds. These women are political leaders, doctors, lawyers, teachers, accountants, and hold other influential positions. Lambda Theta Alpha has also paved the way for many other Latina organizations, which also strive to empower and educate the community. From 1975 to date, Lambda Theta Alpha has upheld its purpose and mission, each day realizing the Founders dream  that it may serve as a quintessential trailblazer for all women.
          </p>
            <p class="main">
          In the Fall of 2002, the Interested Ladies of Lambda Theta Alpha Latin Sorority, Inc. at Stony Brook University was officially recognized by the organization and in the Fall of 2003 the group was officially recognized by the Stony Brook University. From the time that the group was first formed until 2005, the interest group remained very involved in campus life, using their leadership positions to serve the Stony Brook community as well as the Long Island and New York City communities. 

            </p>
            <p class="main">
            In the Spring of 2006, Eighteen dedicated ladies began the journey towards becoming Founding Sisters of Lambda Theta Alpha Latin Sorority, Incorporated at Stony Brook University. Their patience, characters, and motivation were tested, but they prevailed stronger than ever. Their dreams were realized. The fruits of all their labor, dedication, and sacrifice matured as four years of dreaming finally became their reality with the formation and establishment of DELTA ZETA CHAPTER at Stony Brook University.
